# Ray Tracing Project

The aim of the exercise was to get acquainted with issues related to RayTracing. As an introduction to the problem, an example of a program implementing the simplest ray casting algorithm was presented. The second stage was the implementation of a programming project involving the implementation of the Recursive Ray Tracing algorithm.

Tasks carried out in the project
* Build a basic RayTracer model
* Drawing a sample scene

## Instruction

After starting the program, select the scene by entering in the console:
```
> Filename: scene_1.txt
```
or 
```
> Filename: scene_2.txt
```

## View

Drawing an exemplary scene consisting of 9 spheres and 5 light sources.
